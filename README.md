# Smpkg, Duel Platform Package Manager
## What Is Smpkg?
smpkg is a script entirely written in python which provides a GNU/Linux Package manager like functionality to Android and Windows. Current builds are in very early stages and only support Windows packages with no repository yet.

## Why Smpkg?
Smpkg directly fetches downloads for the desired app present in the repository eliminating searching for apps on the web.
